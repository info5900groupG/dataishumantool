                                <h4>Project Background</h4>
                                <p>With the development of machine learning techniques, the analysis of large-scale data sets (LSDS) have been increasingly applied in many research fields outside of computer science, and become the norm <a href="http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/2160/1160"><i class="fa fa-external-link fa-fw"></i></a>. The results of these applications have been promising despite the challenges of working with varied, incomplete (often referred to as “messy”) data types. One of the core aspects of these challenges is the change of context for machine learning experts applying their skills to new domains. In the data analysis process, apart from computational labor, a great of “human work” is always required. This includes recognizing feasible situations through preliminary data-analytics, framing issues amenable to machine analysis, devising data representations, etc.</p>
                                <p>As most of this human work is trial and error, difficult to articulate, and sub-conscious, data experts may not keep documentation of these actions, or consider them relevant when explaining their data analysis process. Instead, they tend to only report what they consider to be key milestones or meaningful attempts. This is problematic because it ignores the fact that the data can have a host of issues. As described by Lawrence Busch, some of these issues include: “lossiness” (loss of some meaning due to transformation), layering (wrongly assuming all prior data is equally relevant), or standardization (applying techniques that fit into the research field) <a href="http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/2160/1160"><i class="fa fa-external-link fa-fw"></i></a>.</p>
                                <p>By underreporting the complete data analysis process, experts may be creating a poor understanding of the data analysis for experts from different academic backgrounds. This means that things are known differentially among different actors. Furthermore, it makes it difficult for other researchers to adequately repeat or review. It is also important to consider how this data analysis is being presented because it is often used when making public and private policy decisions <a href="http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/2160/1160"><i class="fa fa-external-link fa-fw"></i></a>. For example, in her foundational research on representations in work, Lucy Suchman notes that “In the case of many forms of service work, we recognize that the better the work is done, the less visible it is to those who benefit from it” <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/223248.223263"><i class="fa fa-external-link fa-fw"></i></a>. Modern day data analysis still falls victim to connotations collusion due to the lack of transparency in the process.</p>
                                <p>The motivation of the present project is to better understand the sociological aspects of the everyday work practices of data analytics and to advance data-analytic research and training. In this project, we conduct data analysis with close attention to the aforementioned problems related to human work of data analytics, such that we can conceptualize and represent them by means of human-computer interaction design methodology.</p>

                    <p>This project explores the human work of data analysis and aims provide a better understanding of the sociological aspects of everyday work practices in data analytics. We conduct our own data analysis on Reddit World News headlines and Dow Jones Industrial Average stock prices. Three forms of feature selection were used with logistic regression to predict the stock index trend. The final result was a 52% prediction accuracy. While proceeding from data collection to results, we tracked every single human decision and action with fine detail. The log of this data was then evaluated and used to inform the present proof-of-concept design. Following this project, the next step is to create a dynamic web page that collects and displays the data analysis process as the analyst does their daily work. Such a tool will improve the fit between technical tools and solutions to real world problems.

                            <p>Predicting stock price movement helps businesses estimate their long-term health and profitability, as well as make the best decisions on future projects. It also provides an opportunity for investors and stock brokers to make strategic portfolio decisions, like whether to short or long a stock, in hopes of generating greater financial returns. For these reasons, numerous studies have tried to identify ways in which stock predictions can be made, in the face of market irrationality.</p>
                            <p>Public and legally acceptable information that would influence movement of a particular stock is generally limited to company press releases, third-party news about companies and their financial status, and current events that may affect a company or industry. (We will refer to these sources as “all available information”.) Because of this, a large subset of natural language research has developed to examine the potential for predictive models of stock price, based on the qualitative and text-based content within these sources. In 1996, Costantino, Collingham, and Morgan, extracted qualitative information to produce templates that provided a meta-analysis of the effects of news on price behavior [5]. This was one of the first examples of employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) in finance.</p>

                            <p>A more recent work by Pablo Azar used sentiment analysis to study the relationship between numerical data from financial markets and verbal information from financial news [2]. This study was based on the “efficient market hypothesis” which claims that there is rarely disagreement about market returns because they affect the true value of products and services. Therefore positive returns are good, and negative returns are bad.</p>
                            <p>Other approaches have drawn strongly from behavioral economics, which claims that besides all available information, human emotions that come from behavioral bias affect stock prices [1]. For example, a 2011 study entitled “Twitter mood predicts the stock market” investigated whether collective mood states from Twitter feeds were correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Researchers analyzed the text content of daily Twitter feeds with the use of two mood tracking tools: OpinionFinder which measures positive vs. negative mood, and Google-Profile of Mood States which employs a 6-dimensional mood measurement. Their model predicted the daily up and down changes in DJIA closing values with 86.7% accuracy, and these results indicated that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of certain public mood dimensions [3].</p>

                                <li>Prior research indicates this content is relevant to real world applications.

                                        <li>The data reflects daily life, therefore the model we would create to analyze it may tell us something useful about how it manifests in real world practice.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>Both data sets have a large amount of data, ranging 8 years, and different data types.

                                        <li>We can then apply NLP (natural language processing) methods to the text-based news data and combine the two data sets to do machine learning train. By a logistical model, we can design a prediction algorithm that will hopefully tell whether the stock market close price would increase or not based on the corresponding news.</li>

                            <p>The first data set used in this research is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). One of the notable aspects of this data set is the fact that stocks close on the weekends. Therefore, there is no data between the closing price on Friday and the opening price on the following Monday. These missing values were important to consider, particularly for an analysis based on changing values over time.</p>

                            <p>We began by computing the polarity score of combined news headlines, in order to determine the negativity or positivity of a given day. Examination of the results displayed in the table below indicated that there may have been a flaw in our approach, because the compound scores representing a day's polarity were all very close and all negative. We discovered that the Vader module used in the computation was designed for individual sentences, therefore we decided to compute scores for individual headlines instead.</p>
                            <p>At this point, the data was used in a training set for the logistic regression model. There were a total of seven trials using slightly modified inputs in order to produce a result that accurately reflected the data set. The first major change mitigated the missing values for stock price on the weekend by analyzing news polarity data in advance of 1 to 3 days per stock price. The data was then divided such that 80% was used to train the model, and the remaining 20% to test. The final two components were computing the rate of change in polarity to parallel the nature of the binary label that shows stock price movement, and weighting the headlines based on rank.</p>

                                          <li>The system produced the result "neutral" for words like "war" and "attack". Which we believed to be negative.</li>
                                          <li>Based on the results, we have reason to believe that all nouns and verbs are considered neutral.</li>

                                <p>The module was created by using 10 participants to label words on a scale ranging from -4 (extremely negative) to 4 (extremely positive). A neutral word is given a score of 0. Each sentence has three resulting scores: pos_sum, neg_sum, neu_count. pos_sum is the sum of all positively scored words, neg_sum is similarly the score of all negatively scored words, and neu_count is the count of all neutral words in the sentence.</p>
                                Computing each score:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Positive score: pos_sum / total</li>
                                    <li>Negative score: neg_sum / total</li>
                                    <li>Neutral score: neu_count / total</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>A total score sums the three individual scores above. A compound score is then calculated by normalizing the total score, putting the result on a scale ranging from -1 (extremely negative) to 1 (extremely positive).</p>

The Vader module is dependent on the number of words in the sentence, therefore it will produce more accurate results if we consider each headline to be its own sentence. We keep polarity scores separated into four categories (positive, negative, neutral, compound) because these features will be considered when training the prediction model.</p>

                            <p>The accuracy rate of previous logistic model is about 0.52, which is not obvious higher than throwing a coin. So far we can not draw our conclusion that the news data has no effect on stock movement. And there are still many ways to improve the accuracy rate in next period work.</p>
                            <p>First, we can change our datasets. Now we are using a worldwide and not financial-oriented news dataset to promote the DJIA movement. We can put new datasets which are more strongly related to financial news in America. Meanwhile, we can add other stock markets’ price dataset to our data collection.</p>
                            <p>Second, we may use other nlp (natural language processing) algorithm, and use finance corpus to train the model. There are also many algorithms involving deep learning field, such as LSTM (long-short term method), that may fit this case. 
                            </p>
                            <p>What’s more, the missing value of stock data (there are not data in Saturday and Sunday for the market is closed) should be fully considered. And we may use weekly value as a unit value to avoid the missing value problem.</p>
