                            <p>Predicting stock price movement helps businesses estimate their long-term health and profitability, as well as make the best decisions on future projects. It also provides an opportunity for investors and stock brokers to make strategic portfolio decisions, like whether to short or long a stock, in hopes of generating greater financial returns. For these reasons, numerous studies have tried to identify ways in which stock predictions can be made, in the face of market irrationality.</p><p>Public and legally acceptable information that would influence movement of a particular stock is generally limited to company press releases, third-party news about companies and their financial status, and current events that may affect a company or industry. (We will refer to these sources as “all available information”.) Because of this, a large subset of natural language research has developed to examine the potential for predictive models of stock price, based on the qualitative and text-based content within these sources. In 1996, Costantino, Collingham, and Morgan, extracted qualitative information to produce templates that provided a meta-analysis of the effects of news on price behavior (CITE http://www.advanced-finance.com/sites/default/files/publications/neuro96_CostantinoCollinghamMorgan_Qualitative%20Information%20in%20Finance%20NLP%20and%20IE.pdf). This was one of the first examples of employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) in finance.</p>
                            <p>Prior research has used the Google index to build a model that predicts Bitcoin prices. The Google index curve about the word "bitcoin" strongly influenced the bitcoin price curve, and researchers found that social media played an important role.</p>
                            <p>Other approaches have drawn strongly from behavioral economics, which claims that besides all available information, human emotions that come from behavioral bias affect stock prices (CITE http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Article/3315202/Asset-Management-Equities/The-Great-Divide-over-Market-Efficiency.html#.WENPJqIrKRs). For example, a 2011 study entitled “Twitter mood predicts the stock market” investigated whether collective mood states from Twitter feeds were correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Researchers analyzed the text content of daily Twitter feeds with the use of two mood tracking tools: OpinionFinder which measures positive vs. negative mood, and Google-Profile of Mood States which employs a 6-dimensional mood measurement. Their model predicted the daily up and down changes in DJIA closing values with 86.7% accuracy, and these results indicated that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of certain public mood dimensions (CITE http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187775031100007X).</p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>The aim of this research is to determine whether there exists a predictive pattern between stock price movement and current events. To do this, we examine the global stock price and global news headlines.</p>

                            <p>One of the notable aspects of this data set is the fact that stocks close on the weekends. Therefore, there is no data between the closing price on Friday and the opening price on the following Monday. These missing values were important to consider, particularly for an analysis based on changing values over time.</p>
                            <p>The second data set is RedditNews. Features of this data set include the date, label, headline, and ranking. It compiles new headlines from the Reddit World News Channel for the aforementioned date range (August 8, 2008 to July 1, 2016) with a label that represents the DJIA stock price movement. "1" means DJIA Adj Close value rose or stayed as the same. "0" means DJIA Adj Close value decreased. The headlines are ranked by how many votes they received from reddit users. In this case, the news headlines from the weekends are omitted.</p>

                            <p>We began by computing the polarity score of combined news headlines, in order to determine the negativity or positivity of a given day. Examination of the results displayed in the table below indicated that there may have been a flaw in our approach, because the compound scores representing a day's polarity were all very close and all negative. We discovered that the Vader module used in the computation was designed for individual sentences, therefore we decided to compute scores for individual headlines instead.</p>
                            <p>At this point, the data was used in a training set for the logistic regression model. There were a total of seven trials using slightly modified inputs in order to produce a result that accurately reflected the data set. The first major change mitigated the missing values for stock price on the weekend by analyzing news polarity data in advance of 1 to 3 days per stock price. The data was then divided such that 80% was used to train the model, and the remaining 20% to test. The final two components were computing the rate of change in polarity to parallel the nature of the binary label that shows stock price movement, and weighting the headlines based on rank.</p>

                                <p>The vader_lexicon.txt corpus from nltk.sentiment.vader module was used to calculate the polarity score of the top 25 headlines combined, resulting in a polarity score that represents the negativity or positivity of each day.</p>

                                          <li>The system produced the result "neutral" for words like "war" and "attack". Which we believed to be negative.</li>
                                          <li>Based on the results, we have reason to believe that all nouns and verbs are considered neutral.</li>
                                          <li>For the aforementioned reasons, we felt it was not a suitable tool to analyze news headlines.</li>

                                    <li>The <a href="#">Vader module</a> returns four features: positive, negative, neutral, and compound. We found it to be appropriately sensitive to the type of content that can be found in news headlines.

                                <p>The module was created by using 10 participants to label words on a scale ranging from -4 (extremely negative) to 4 (extremely positive). A neutral word is given a score of 0. Each sentence has three resulting scores: pos_sum, neg_sum, neu_count. pos_sum is the sum of all positively scored words, neg_sum is similarly the score of all negatively scored words, and neu_count is the count of all neutral words in the sentence.</p>
                                Computing each score:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Positive score: pos_sum / total</li>
                                    <li>Negative score: neg_sum / total</li>
                                    <li>Neutral score: neu_count / total</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>A total score sums the three individual scores above. A compound score is then calculated by normalizing the total score, putting the result on a scale ranging from -1 (extremely negative) to 1 (extremely positive).</p>

                                <p>In our previous computation, all compound scores approximated -1 because on average there were more negative words in the combined headlines, so the absolute value of negative scores was always larger than that of positive scores. The Vader module is dependent on the number of words in the sentence, therefore it will produce more accurate results if we consider each headline to be its own sentence. We keep polarity scores separated into four categories (positive, negative, neutral, compound) because these features will be considered when training the prediction model.</p>

                            <p>The accuracy rate of previous logistic model is about 0.52, which is not obvious higher than throwing a coin. So far we can not draw our conclusion that the news data has no effect on stock movement. And there are still many ways to improve the accuracy rate in next period work.</p>
                            <p>First, we can change our datasets. Now we are using a worldwide and not financial-oriented news dataset to promote the DJIA movement. We can put new datasets which are more strongly related to financial news in America. Meanwhile, we can add other stock markets’ price dataset to our data collection.</p>
                            <p>Second, we may use other nlp (natural language processing) algorithm, and use finance corpus to train the model. There are also many algorithms involving deep learning field, such as LSTM (long-short term method), that may fit this case. 
                            </p>
                            <p>What’s more, the missing value of stock data (there are not data in Saturday and Sunday for the market is closed) should be fully considered. And we may use weekly value as a unit value to avoid the missing value problem.</p>
